# To-Do

<img src="https://github.com/jzkarap/To-Do/blob/master/to-do.gif?raw=true">

To-Do creates a persistent array of to-do tasks using your browser's local storage. It truncates posts which are too long to fit within the width of the list, and surfaces them on a mouseover as a tooltip bound to the cursor position. Tasks can be created and deleted, and these actions will be accurately reflected by the list within local storage.

To add:

- Mobile layout
- Ability to directly edit existing tasks
- Animated background gradient
- Allow generation of new lists, with unique titles

---

To fix:

- Stutter when sliding up new task input
- Tooltip on new items does not initially appear in correct position
- Add booleans to keep track of whether or not user has crossed out an item in the list (so that crossed-out items will be remembered on next visit after page is closed)
